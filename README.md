# Python-game

The game is targeted at mastering the use of python switch and loop states.
I used so many online resources to come to this final conclusion for the game, starting from using the Zuri Python Youtube tutorial sections
to learn about python imports and its use cases. I equally used some online resources such as Realpython.com to learn about the module random 
function and how to make the computer choose a random choice of the game. The mode of the game is that it requires the first player to choose from
a certain choice in our case Scissors,Paper and Rocks and it determines what happens and prompt the user or player the final result. I equally went
deeper from the task to include an extra part of the game for lizard and spock.
